<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="date">Effective date: February 23, 2026</p>

<p>Portfolio Compass ("we", "our", "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect and how we use it.</p>

<h2>Data We Collect</h2>
<p><strong>Account information:</strong> When you sign in with Google or Apple, we receive your name, email address, and profile picture. We store this to identify your account and verify Pro subscription status.</p>
<p><strong>Portfolio data:</strong> The stock tickers and allocation percentages you enter are processed locally in your browser. Pro users may optionally sync portfolios to our servers.</p>
<p><strong>AI features:</strong> When you use AI-powered features (e.g. "Why This Pick?", screenshot import), your portfolio summary is sent to our server to generate a response via the Anthropic API. This data is not stored after the response is generated.</p>
<p><strong>Usage data:</strong> We track API request counts per user for rate limiting. We log IP addresses for abuse prevention.</p>

<h2>Local Storage</h2>
<p>The app uses your browser's local storage to remember saved portfolios, theme preferences, and session tokens. This data stays on your device and is not transmitted to us unless you use cloud sync.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
<p><strong>Google Sign-In</strong> — for authentication. We receive your name, email, and profile picture. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's privacy policy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Anthropic Claude API</strong> — to generate AI-powered portfolio explanations. Data sent includes your portfolio tickers, allocations, and sector exposure. See <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy">Anthropic's privacy policy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Yahoo Finance API</strong> — to fetch real-time stock prices. Only ticker symbols are sent. No personal data is shared.</p>
<p><strong>Stripe</strong> — to process Pro subscription payments. We do not store your payment information. See <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy">Stripe's privacy policy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Vercel</strong> — hosts the application. Standard server logs (IP address, browser type) may be collected. See <a href="https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy">Vercel's privacy policy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Neon</strong> — database hosting for user accounts and cloud-synced portfolios. See <a href="https://neon.tech/privacy">Neon's privacy policy</a>.</p>

<h2>Analytics</h2>
<p>We do not use analytics tracking, cookies, or advertising SDKs.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>The app is not directed at children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page.</p>
