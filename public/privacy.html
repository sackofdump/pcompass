<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="date">Effective date: February 22, 2026</p>

<p>Portfolio Compass ("we", "our", "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect and how we use it.</p>

<h2>Data We Collect</h2>
<p>Portfolio Compass does not require account creation or login. The stock tickers and allocation percentages you enter are processed locally in your browser and are not stored on our servers.</p>
<p>When you use the "Why This Pick?" AI feature, your portfolio summary is sent to our server to generate a personalized explanation via the Anthropic API. This data is not stored after the response is generated.</p>

<h2>Local Storage</h2>
<p>The app uses your browser's local storage to remember saved portfolios and usage counts (such as the number of free AI explanations used). This data stays on your device and is not transmitted to us.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
<p><strong>Anthropic Claude API</strong> — to generate AI-powered portfolio explanations. Data sent includes your portfolio tickers, allocations, and sector exposure. See <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy">Anthropic's privacy policy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Yahoo Finance API</strong> — to fetch real-time stock prices. Only ticker symbols are sent. No personal data is shared.</p>
<p><strong>Stripe</strong> — to process Pro subscription payments. We do not store your payment information. See <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy">Stripe's privacy policy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Vercel</strong> — hosts the application. Standard server logs (IP address, browser type) may be collected. See <a href="https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy">Vercel's privacy policy</a>.</p>

<h2>Analytics</h2>
<p>We do not use analytics tracking, cookies, or advertising SDKs.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>The app is not directed at children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
